# GreenBot-AI
 In today’s digital era, AI-powered chatbots are transforming the way individuals and
 institutions communicate by offering intelligent, automated responses with minimal hu
man intervention. This project presents an AI Chatbot developed using Unsupervised
 Learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering combined with semantic search.
 The chatbot is trained using a structured JSON dataset that contains questions, answers,
 and keywords tailored to specific domains, making it adaptable to a wide range of ap
plications—from educational support to customer service—depending on the provided
 data.
 Unlike traditional supervised learning systems that require labeled datasets, this
 chatbot leverages unsupervised learning to group similar types of user queries. Once
 clustering is complete, it uses keyword-boosted cosine similarity to match user inputs
 with relevant responses. This design not only reduces the need for manual data labeling
 but also enables scalability and flexibility in various domains.
